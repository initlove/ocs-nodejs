rewrite it. I think we need not have the 'folder' concept.

status - read, unread, answered (read: answered included)

New arguments:  
    with -  get the messages bettween login user with someone
    search - the content of the query 

/message?search="vip"&with=someoneelse&page=0&pagesize=10&status=read

trick usage:
    with=loginuser: get the messages you sent and received
